### FAQ

1. __The correct answer's checkbox value is _true_, so the quiz-taker can cheat with little effort just by inspecting each choice element! Why is this so?__
  * It is by design. Keep in mind that this is made for the sole purpose of self-review, it is up to the quiz taker if he/she decides to cheat.
2. __Where's the documentation?__
  * Sorry about that. I haven't been able to find time to write docs, I'll update this as soon as possible.
